ques.1 what is inheritance ?explain with exaples.
ans.  Inheritance in java is a method in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of parent object.
For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents.

ques. 2. why we need to use inheritance ?
ans. i.) for code reuseability.
     ii.) for method overriding.

ques.3  what is the keyword used to achieve inheritance in java?
ans.    'extends' keyword is use to achieve inheritance in java.

ques. 4. what is the use of "superkeyword"?
ans. The 'supper' keyword is used to refer immediate parentclass (superclass) objects.

ques.5 How can a sub-class call a constructor of the super class?
ans.  To explicitly call the superclass constructor from the subclass constructor, we use super()  keyword.

ques.6 . What is method overriding?
ans. If sub class has the same method as declared in parent class is known as method overriding. 
    -->  The method must have same name as in the parent class.
    -->  The method must have the same parameter as in parent class.
    -->  There must be a Is-A (parent-child) Relationship.

ques.7. Is multiple inheritance supported in Java?
ans.    Multiple Inheritance is not supported by java using classes.

ques.8. What is “Dynamic Binding”?
ans.   Dynamic Binding is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time.
       It is also called polymorphism, dynamic method dispatch, upcasting, late Binding. 


ques.9. What is “Overloading resolution”, how it is done?
ans. 

ques.10. Which keyword is used to prevent inheritance?
ans. Use 'final' keyword when creating the class.

ques.11. Can a final method be overridden?
ans.  No, we cannot override a  final method. 

ques.12. What are abstract classes, why are they used?
ans.  A class which is declared with the help of abstrct keyword is called abstract class. It has abstract and non-abstract methods.
