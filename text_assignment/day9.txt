que. 1.What are the three types of variables in Java?
Ans. There are three types of variables in java:
    • local variable 
    • instance variable 
    • static variable 
1) Local Variable
    i. A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. 
    ii. You can use this variable only within that method 
    iii. And The other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists. 
    iv. A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.
2) Instance Variable
    i. A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. 
    ii. It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.
3) Static variable
    i. A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable.
    ii.  Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.


que. 2.How many copies of a static variable are kept in the JVM.
Ans. Only one copy of a static member exists, regardless of how many instances of the class are created.

que. 3.What is the other name given to static variables? 
Ans. Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a    block.

que. 4.Can we change the value of static variables in the instance methods of the class?
Ans. Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables or the this reference.
